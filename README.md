# provisions
A place to keep useful Vagrant/Ansible/etc plays.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Vagrant for your platform: http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads
2. Install Ansible: `sudo pip install ansible` or http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html

Once installed, head to one of the sub projects (https://github.com/shudgston/provisions/tree/master/jenkins) and give it a spin.
