# Jenkins



## Installation

You can copy this directory to wherever you like to keep Vagrant files.

With Ansible and Vagrant already installed, run the following command from this directory.

```
vagrant up
```

When everything completes, you should have a running barebones jenkins server accessible from localhost:8080.
